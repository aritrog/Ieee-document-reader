This is a desktop software for getting the pdf documents from Ieee.

Everything that can be accessed through this software is already available in public domain.

This software only makes it easier to do the same.

I sincerely hope that this is used only for educational purposes.

The file display.py implicitly call the other class hence this is the only file that is needed to be executed.
